// What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved in the projects for this course covered data structures.  During project one we were to 
create psuedocode for a program that will pull data from csv file, store it in a data structure, and then pull specific 
data from the sata structure and organize it in a alphanumeric order.  During project one we also focused on reun-time, trees, graphs, 
and linked lists.  During project two we were to take our psuedocode 
from project one and then execute it into a working program.  

// How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem we were to provide multiple data structures in psuedocode and then determine 
which data structure worked best for the project.  The data structure chosen was the hash table.  This 
data structure used less memory to store the data by compressing the data into smaller sizes.   

// How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks I encountered while going through the activities/project, I reviewed feedback 
provided for graded assignments and used my reading assignments along with other online resources.  These helped 
me to see exactly where I needed to fix. 

// How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work I did on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by showing me how 
data structures and algorithms work, and their importance.  By learning different data structures, you can beter determine 
what data structure works best for the project, and then can implement this when designing and developing.  

// How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work I did on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by having me practice each week 
in assignments that had me work on clear code with explainations and even explaing the code in a journal that made me explain the codes purpose, and then writing the psuedocode for it.
